# Project-Management-Dashboard

While building the project management dashboard in Excel, I learned invaluable skills in data visualization, analysis, and dashboard design. I gained proficiency in leveraging Excel's features such as PivotTables, charts, and conditional formatting to represent project metrics effectively. Through this process, I honed my ability to interpret complex datasets, identify trends, and communicate insights visually. Additionally, I learned to customize and streamline the dashboard layout to cater to specific stakeholder needs, enhancing clarity and usability. This experience not only improved my technical Excel skills but also deepened my understanding of project management principles and the importance of clear, concise reporting in driving informed decision-making.
